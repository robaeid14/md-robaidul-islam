    <h1>Section 13: Test Adequacy Assessment</h1>

    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>Test adequacy assessment determines how sufficient and effective a set of test cases is in testing a software application. It helps in understanding how well the software has been tested and whether additional tests are needed.</p>

    <h2>Adequacy Criteria</h2>
    <p>Adequacy criteria are the rules or requirements that a test set must satisfy to be considered adequate. Common adequacy criteria include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Statement coverage</li>
      <li>Branch coverage</li>
      <li>Path coverage</li>
      <li>Condition coverage</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Control Flow Based Criteria</h2>
    <p>This criterion evaluates how well the test cases exercise the control flow (decision points, loops, etc.) of a program. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Statement Coverage:</strong> Ensures all statements are executed at least once.</li>
      <li><strong>Branch Coverage:</strong> Ensures all branches (true/false outcomes) of decision points are tested.</li>
      <li><strong>Path Coverage:</strong> Ensures all possible paths in the control flow graph are covered.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Flow Based Criteria</h2>
    <p>This criterion assesses the interaction of program variables throughout the execution. It includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Definition-Use (DU) Pairs:</strong> Covers all combinations of variable definitions and their corresponding uses.</li>
      <li><strong>All-Defs and All-Uses Criteria:</strong> Requires that each variableâ€™s definition is tested with all its uses (computational or predicate).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mutation Based Criteria</h2>
    <p>This criterion uses small changes (mutants) in the program code to test whether the test cases can detect them. If a test case fails when a mutant is introduced, the test is considered strong.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mutation Score:</strong> Percentage of mutants detected by the test cases.</li>
      <li><strong>Equivalent Mutants:</strong> Mutants that do not change the behavior of the program and cannot be detected.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Adequacy as a Stopping Criterion</h2>
    <p>Test adequacy can serve as a metric to decide when to stop testing. If a certain adequacy level (e.g., 90% branch coverage) is reached, further testing might not be necessary.</p>

    <h2>Adequacy as a Tool for Test Enhancement</h2>
    <p>By analyzing adequacy metrics, testers can identify untested areas and add more test cases to improve coverage. This leads to better quality and higher reliability of the software.</p>

        <li>Common criteria: control flow, data flow, and mutation-based.</li>
        <li>Used as a guideline to stop or enhance testing efforts.</li>
