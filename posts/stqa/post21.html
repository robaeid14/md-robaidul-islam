    <h1>Section 21: Software Quality Management Process</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Software Quality Management (SQM) ensures that software products meet quality standards throughout the development lifecycle. It integrates various principles, processes, and practices like Total Quality Management (TQM), continuous improvement, and quality planning to ensure both product and process quality.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Total Quality Management (TQM)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>TQM is a comprehensive, organization-wide approach focused on continuous quality improvement.</li>
      <li>Key principles include:
        <ul>
          <li>Customer-focused development</li>
          <li>Total employee involvement</li>
          <li>Process-centered approach</li>
          <li>Integrated system of quality management</li>
          <li>Data-driven decision making</li>
          <li>Continuous improvement (Kaizen)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>TQM promotes a quality culture across all levels of an organization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Software Quality Improvement Cycle</h2>
    <p>
      The improvement cycle is used to identify weaknesses and iteratively enhance software quality.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Plan:</strong> Identify quality objectives, define metrics, and outline improvement strategies.</li>
      <li><strong>Do:</strong> Implement improvements and gather data.</li>
      <li><strong>Check:</strong> Analyze performance data to evaluate results.</li>
      <li><strong>Act:</strong> Take corrective actions or standardize successful changes.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is often referred to as the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle.</p>

    <h2>4. SQA Planning and Management</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Software Quality Assurance (SQA) planning is a critical part of the software development plan.</li>
      <li>Elements of an SQA plan:
        <ul>
          <li>Objectives and scope of quality activities</li>
          <li>Standards, procedures, and tools to be used</li>
          <li>Roles and responsibilities of the SQA team</li>
          <li>Quality metrics and checkpoints</li>
          <li>Audit and review schedules</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Quality management ensures alignment with business goals and regulatory compliance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Organizing the SQA Effort</h2>
    <p>
      The structure of SQA efforts varies based on project size and complexity but generally includes:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>SQA Team:</strong> A dedicated team responsible for monitoring and enforcing quality practices.</li>
      <li><strong>Management Involvement:</strong> Project managers and leadership support ensure quality is a top priority.</li>
      <li><strong>Defined Roles:</strong> Clear definition of tasks such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Reviewing code and documents</li>
          <li>Performing audits and inspections</li>
          <li>Measuring and reporting quality metrics</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Integration with Development:</strong> SQA activities must be embedded within the development process, not treated as a separate or final step.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      A robust Software Quality Management process ensures consistency, reliability, and customer satisfaction. It blends strategic planning with daily operational practices like SQA, audits, continuous improvement, and team collaboration to deliver high-quality software products.
