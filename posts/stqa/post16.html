    <h1>Section 16: Definition and Concept of Software Quality Assurance (SQA)</h1>

    <h2>What is Software Quality Assurance (SQA)?</h2>
    <p>
      Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is a set of activities for ensuring quality in the processes by which software products are developed. It aims to prevent defects in the software development process and ensure that the final product meets the desired quality standards.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Objectives of SQA</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure that software processes and products comply with defined standards.</li>
      <li>Prevent defects through continuous monitoring and improvement.</li>
      <li>Improve development productivity and customer satisfaction.</li>
      <li>Promote quality culture among the development team.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Main Components of SQA</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Standards:</strong> Defined development and testing standards (e.g., ISO 9001, IEEE).</li>
      <li><strong>Processes:</strong> Structured development processes like SDLC, Agile, or Waterfall.</li>
      <li><strong>Procedures:</strong> Defined steps for handling specific activities like code review or testing.</li>
      <li><strong>Reviews and Audits:</strong> Regular assessments to check compliance with standards.</li>
      <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Verifies that the software works as expected.</li>
      <li><strong>Metrics:</strong> Measurements of process and product quality (e.g., defect density, code coverage).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Benefits of Implementing SQA</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduces cost by detecting issues early.</li>
      <li>Ensures higher customer satisfaction and reliability.</li>
      <li>Promotes better documentation and traceability.</li>
      <li>Improves teamwork and accountability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Difference Between QA and QC</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Quality Assurance (QA):</strong> Focuses on process improvement and defect prevention.</li>
      <li><strong>Quality Control (QC):</strong> Focuses on detecting defects in the actual product.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>SQA in Different Software Development Models</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>In <strong>Waterfall</strong>, SQA activities are planned at the beginning and conducted at each phase.</li>
      <li>In <strong>Agile</strong>, SQA is integrated into daily tasks with continuous testing and feedback.</li>
      <li>In <strong>DevOps</strong>, SQA is automated and integrated into CI/CD pipelines.</li>
    </ul>
